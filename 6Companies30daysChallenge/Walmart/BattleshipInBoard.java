/*
 * Given an m x n matrix board where each cell is a battleship 'X' or empty '.',
 * return the number of the battleships on board.
 * 
 * Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically on board. In other
 * words, they can only be made of the shape 1 x k (1 row, k columns) or k x 1
 * (k rows, 1 column), where k can be of any size. At least one horizontal or
 * vertical cell separates between two battleships (i.e., there are no adjacent
 * battleships).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: board = [["X",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"]]
 * Output: 2
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: board = [["."]]
 * Output: 0
